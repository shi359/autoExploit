# autoExploit ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/Django.svg)
Scan port services with Nmap and do metaexploit

## About
This project is made during my intern in ITRI.<br>
autoExploit uses Nmap to scan ports and do Metasploit after scanning.

## How to Use

- Run `python3 AutoExploit.py -a <ip address> -n <nmap scan result> -k <keyword of msf exploit module>`
- Note that the nmap scan result should be in json format
- -n and -k arguments are optional
- If nmap scan result is not provided, AutoExploit.py will use nmap to scan the host, which may takes longer time.
- Please refer config.ini for detail configuration
